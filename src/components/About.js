                    A year ago pandemic protocol made people difficult to donate things to orphanage
                    as they were not allowed to visit us. Thus we wanted to build a user friendly way of
                    donation, but we realized there is no better way than this to give a donar there own
                    way of donation just by there home.
                    <br></br><br></br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    Henceforth, this is donation web application where donar can easily 
                    donate in this pandemic situation.This is paper less, time efficient
                    and reduce manual work process.
